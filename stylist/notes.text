start with mockup and css just to get a feel for what is needed,
so like a bunch of divs and then some css.

make sure to import into App
With a new component make sure to import React and export the const.


I was using class and render instead of const.

(prevState, props) => ( some_value )
(prevState, props) => { ...; ...; return some_value; }
function (prevState, props) { ...; ...; return some_value; }
